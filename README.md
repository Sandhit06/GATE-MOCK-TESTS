## 3. Comprehensive Python Files Guide

Below is a detailed breakdown of all **23 Python (`.py`) files** in the project, organized by category:

### Category A: Core Engine & Publishing Scripts (`scripts/`)

#### 1. `scripts/common.py`
* **What it does:** The central library module containing core data structures, algorithms, and validation rules used by all other scripts.
* **Key Functions:**
  * `load_bank(root)`: Loads canonical questions from `data/questions.jsonl`.
  * `reviewed_content_hash(q)`: Calculates a deterministic SHA-256 fingerprint over a question's stem, options, answer, solution, and option explanations to cryptographically bind reviews to question content.
  * `render_paper(questions, paper)`: Converts structured question records into student-ready Markdown papers: `README.md` (Question paper + instructions + Answer Key table) and `SOLUTIONS.md` (worked step-by-step solutions).
  * `validate_records(questions, syllabus, paper, root)`: Programmatically verifies that all 65 questions strictly satisfy GATE rules (marks, sections, types, subject allocations, difficulty bounds, and option explanations).
  * `validate_rendered(questions, paper, root)`: Verifies that published Markdown files match canonical bank records without corruption or syntax errors.
* **How to run:** Imported as a module; not intended to be run directly.

#### 2. `scripts/build.py`
* **What it does:** The primary publication script. Reads accepted question records from `data/questions.jsonl`, runs pre-publication audits, and renders official Markdown papers (`papers/Mock_XXX/README.md` and `papers/Mock_XXX/SOLUTIONS.md`).
* **Protection:** Prevents overwriting previously published papers if content has altered.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  # Publish a specific paper (e.g., Paper 2)
  python scripts/build.py --paper 2 --resume

  # Publish a range of papers
  python scripts/build.py --start 1 --end 10 --resume
  ```

#### 3. `scripts/validate.py`
* **What it does:** The quality audit engine. Performs comprehensive structural, mathematical, and syllabus checks across all papers or the entire 100-paper series. Exits with code 0 on PASS, or non-zero on any violation.
* **Key Checks:** 65 questions per paper, 100 marks total, 15M GA, 13M Engineering Math, 72M Core CS across all 9 subjects, exact difficulty ranges, and cryptographic review verification.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  # Validate a single paper
  python scripts/validate.py --paper 2

  # Validate a range of papers
  python scripts/validate.py --start 1 --end 2

  # Run full-series release audit
  python scripts/validate.py --final
  ```

#### 4. `scripts/accept_review.py`
* **What it does:** The quality gatekeeper for importing new questions into the permanent bank `data/questions.jsonl`. Questions cannot enter the bank without a matching, content-bound independent review file.
* **How it works:** Compares question hashes against review hashes, checks that independent solutions agree with author answers, enforces uniqueness across the question bank, appends accepted questions to `data/questions.jsonl`, and logs transactions to `data/acceptance_log.jsonl`.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/accept_review.py \
    --questions drafts/mock002_main.json drafts/mock002_core_low.json drafts/mock002_core_high.json \
    --reviews drafts/review_mock002_main.json drafts/review_mock002_core_low.json drafts/review_mock002_core_high.json
  ```

#### 5. `scripts/report.py`
* **What it does:** Generates summary reports and updates the master table.
* **Outputs:**
  * `INDEX.md`: Master table tracking completion and links for Mock 001 to Mock 100.
  * `reports/COVERAGE.md`: Markdown summary of subject and subtopic distribution.
  * `reports/coverage.csv`: CSV matrix showing question counts per subtopic across all papers.
  * `reports/FINAL_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`: Comprehensive audit report showing PASS/FAIL status.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/report.py
  ```

#### 6. `scripts/export.py`
* **What it does:** Converts generated Markdown test papers into standalone, printable HTML files styled with print CSS.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/export.py --paper 1
  ```

#### 7. `scripts/fetch_2027_sources.py`
* **What it does:** Web fetch utility to download official GATE syllabus documents and authority files from organizing institute portals.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/fetch_2027_sources.py
  ```

---

### Category B: Verification & Review Scripts (`scripts/`)

#### 8. `scripts/verify_pilot_main.py`
* **What it does:** Solves and verifies mathematical and General Aptitude questions for Mock 001 from first principles, computing exact derivations and recording evidence in `drafts/review_main_evidence.json`.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/verify_pilot_main.py
  ```

#### 9. `scripts/verify_pilot_core.py`
* **What it does:** Independent code-based solver for Mock 001 Core Computer Science questions. Simulates C pointer code, executes SQLite database transactions, models cache hit/miss behavior, and verifies discrete math theorems.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/verify_pilot_core.py
  ```

#### 10. `scripts/verify_mock002_main.py`
* **What it does:** Independent analytical and combinatorial solver for Mock 002 General Aptitude and Engineering Mathematics questions. Outputs verified solutions and derivations to `drafts/review_mock002_main_evidence.json`.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/verify_mock002_main.py
  ```

#### 11. `scripts/write_review_main.py`
* **What it does:** Serializes independent review records into JSON format (`drafts/review_main.json`), computing cryptographic SHA-256 digests over question payloads to bind reviews to questions.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/write_review_main.py
  ```

---

### Category C: Blueprints & Test Suite

#### 12. `blueprints/make_blueprints.py`
* **What it does:** Deterministically generates the 100-paper blueprint specifications in `blueprints/papers.json` using the random seed (20271012) and constraints in `blueprints/config.json`.
* **How it works:** Cycles through GATE subjects and subtopics, interleaving math and aptitude topics to ensure every paper has the required 65 slots with balanced question types and difficulty targets.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python blueprints/make_blueprints.py
  ```

#### 13. `tests/test_engine.py`
* **What it does:** Automated regression test suite containing 13 unit tests.
* **What it verifies:** Ensures that tampered answer keys are detected, duplicate questions are caught, missing reasoning steps trigger errors, invalid syllabus entries fail, and unverified questions cannot be published.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
  ```

---

### Category D: Historical Research Scripts (`research/historical/`)

  ```

#### 15. `research/historical/fetch_older.py`
* **What it does:** Fetches older historical GATE papers (2015–2018).
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python research/historical/fetch_older.py
  ```

#### 16. `research/historical/count_types.py`
* **What it does:** Parses historical question papers and tabulates question-type distributions (ratio of MCQ to MSQ to NAT) across recent GATE exam years.
* **How to run:**
  ```bash
  python research/historical/count_types.py
  ```

---

### Category E: Draft Authoring & Revision Scripts (`drafts/`)

## 4. How the Test Paper Files Are Structured

For every completed mock test, two markdown files are generated inside `papers/Mock_XXX/`:

1. **`papers/Mock_XXX/README.md` (The Student Question Paper):**
   * Header with Exam Code, Time Limit (180 mins), and Maximum Marks (100).
   * Official General Examination Instructions (marking scheme, negative marking rules).
   * **Section A — General Aptitude:** 10 Questions (Q1 to Q10) with complete stems and options.
   * **Section B — Computer Science & Engineering Mathematics:** 55 Questions (Q11 to Q65) with complete code snippets, equations, and tables.
   * **Answer Key Table:** Complete, clean 65-row lookup table placed at the end of the paper.

2. **`papers/Mock_XXX/SOLUTIONS.md` (The Worked Solutions):**
   * Detailed per-question solutions for all 65 questions.
   * Official correct answer and syllabus concept tag (`Subject — Subtopic`).
   * Step-by-step mathematical, code-trace, or conceptual derivation.
   * For MCQs and MSQs: explicit **Option Explanations** detailing why the correct options are true and why each distractor (A, B, C, D) is eliminated.
   * **Common Misconception:** Explains the psychological or conceptual error that leads students to incorrect options.

## 5. Next Execution Steps: Mock 003 to Mock 100

With Mock 001 and Mock 002 fully completed, verified, and published:
* `blueprints/papers.json` already contains the full blueprints for all 100 papers (Papers 001 through 100, exactly 6,500 slots).
* Test paper generation can proceed directly from the blueprints to create all remaining examination paper files (`papers/Mock_003/` to `papers/Mock_100/`) without requiring manual drafting scripts for each mock.
