# Final validation and completion report

Updated 25 October 2026. **Content population: COMPLETE (100/100). Structural audit: PASS (100/100). Full technical-quality release: NOT YET PASSED.**

The user now permits duplicate questions across papers. This supersedes the original 6,500-unique-question requirement, not the correctness or difficulty requirements.

- Exactly 100 student-facing README papers and 100 SOLUTIONS documents.
- Exactly 6,500 numbered question instances, answer-key rows and solution sections.
- Exactly 6,500 canonical records with unique IDs; 65 retain prior ACCEPTED provenance, 6,435 remain REVIEW_REQUIRED.
- 6,150 distinct question versions after replacing 3,800 repeated occurrences with adapted variants; no exact within-paper repeats. Underlying reasoning is reused.
- All papers: 65 questions, 30 one-mark and 35 two-mark questions, 100 marks, GA 15, mathematics 13, core CS 72.
- Question order, type syntax, four distinct options, answer-set format, NAT precision metadata, solution/key agreement, source-text preservation, final-key placement, nonempty solutions and balanced code fences passed.
- No external figure dependencies were found. Essential visuals use textual or coordinate descriptions; graphical export rendering was not performed.

The audit parsed the saved files independently of assembly and compared them with the canonical bank and source manifest. Evidence: [machine-readable audit](COMPLETION_AUDIT_2026-10-25.json), [coverage](COVERAGE_REPORT.md), [reuse policy](REUSE_POLICY_2026-10-25.md). Matching keys and solution answer lines are consistency checks, not independent mathematical proofs.

## Remaining quality gates

Independent correctness and distractor review remain pending outside previously accepted content. Source-paper reports document targeted checks, corrected mistakes and remaining concerns. Difficulty percentages, the minimum multistep quota and rendered print/export quality are not certified. Planned difficulty is stored separately; unreviewed canonical records do not receive invented difficulty ratings. No human review is claimed. Reused copies inherit these limitations.

Review the 2,350 underlying source questions once and propagate corrections to ordinary copies and the 3,800 transformed variants using their different answer-selection rules. Do not regenerate papers merely because they repeat questions. Research limitations remain as documented in research/SOURCES.md and GATE_PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md; this pass did not perform new historical research.

The first 1,000 variants are integrated into the papers, not assigned as an extra bank. See [replacement mapping](INTEGRATED_1000_REPLACEMENTS.md). All post-replacement structural checks passed.

A second batch replaced another 1,000 repetitive numerical questions with multiple-choice variants. All 4,000 option values and all 100 papers passed the current checks. See [second-batch evidence](INTEGRATED_1000_ROUND2_REPLACEMENTS.md). The total remains 6,500 question instances.

Third batch: 1,000 repeated NAT occurrences replaced with adapted MSQs asking for invalid numerical answers. All 4,000 options and 1,000 complementary answer sets passed interval checks. Previous replacement positions were preserved. [Evidence](INTEGRATED_1000_ROUND3_REPLACEMENTS.md).

Fourth batch: 800 repeated choice questions converted to candidate-validity audit variants. All 800 answer mappings checked. There are now 350 excess exact occurrences across papers; underlying reasoning still repeats. [Round-four evidence](ROUND4_REPLACEMENTS.md).
